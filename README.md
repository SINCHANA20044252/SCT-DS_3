ðŸ§  Decision Tree Classification â€“ Task 03

Overview:
Built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data from the Bank Marketing dataset (UCI ML Repository).

Highlights & Insights:

ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing: Encoded categorical variables, handled missing values.

ðŸ”¹ Model Training: Decision Tree Classifier with controlled depth for clarity and performance.

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

ðŸŒŸ Feature Importance: Identified key factors influencing customer purchase decisions.

ðŸ“‰ Overfitting Check: Visualized accuracy vs tree depth to find optimal model complexity.

Visualizations:
